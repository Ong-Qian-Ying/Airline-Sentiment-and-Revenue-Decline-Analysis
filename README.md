# Airline-Sentiment-and-Churn-Analysis
## Executive Summary:
SkyWings Airlines faced a sharp revenue decline (Business −26%, Economy −18% YoY) alongside rising dissatisfaction posted online. Using KNIME text mining and Tableau KPI dashboards, my team and I linked customer reviews + transactions to pinpoint the biggest drivers: cancellations at 15% vs 2% industry benchmark, and complaints concentrated in poor customer service (35.08%) and low quality perception (34.6%). Hence, we recommended the company to:

1. Reduce flight cancellations with a 3-stage “Service Netting” plan (prevent, respond, recover).
2. Win back returning Economy customers (core revenue segment) via loyalty perks + targeted recovery offers.
3. Redesign promotions (only 16.91% promo usage) to be more visible and targeted.

## Business Problem:
For an airline, bookings and reputation are closely tied to revenue. SkyWings is seeing booking decline while negative reviews online increase, suggesting a breakdown in customer experience and trust.  Despite having relevant data, Skywings has not utilised relevant tools to uncover root causes and take targeted action. What is causing the decline in business performance and what changes should be prioritised to reverse it?
